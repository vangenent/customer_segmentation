# customer_segmentation
Customer segmentation using K-Means on a Kaggle dataset with 200 entries. We cluster customers based on "Annual Income" and "Spending Score," determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method, and calculate silhouette coefficients. Finally, 3D clustering adds "Age" as a feature for deeper insights.
